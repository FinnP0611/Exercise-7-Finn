# Exercise 7: Plotting data in Python

This week we'll put together our data analysis and plotting skills using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the temperature data we have been exploring for the course thus far.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook. Remeber to upload your changes (and related image files) to GitHub!

Check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L7/exercise-7.html) if you're having trouble.

- **Exercise 7 problems 1-5 are due by 4 pm on Monday 28 October 2019**


## Problems 1-5 + FINAL PROBLEM

This week we have 5 problems related to the lesson that are worth **30 points in total**. There is also an additional problem 6 for creating a GIF animation :) 

 - [Problem 1: Random scatter plot (5 points)](Exercise-7-problem-1.ipynb)
 - [Problem 2 - Plotting temperatures (7 points)](Exercise-7-problem-2.ipynb)
 - [Problems 3-5: Weather anomalies (18 points)](Exercise-7-problem-3-5.ipynb)
 - [Problem 6 - Creating a GIF animation from the figures (optional)](Exercise-7-problem-6.ipynb)
 
 In addition, we have a final applied problem with minimal instructions. You can gain extra **10 points** if you complete this task.
